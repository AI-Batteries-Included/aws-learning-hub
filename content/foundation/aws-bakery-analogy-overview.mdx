## The Four Stages

### [Stage 1: Home Kitchen ‚Üí](./aws-bakery-analogy/stage-1)
**Conceptualizing the Website (Local Development)**

You start in your cozy home kitchen, experimenting with different peach cobbler recipes. You write down ideas, test them, then make changes based on what works and what doesn't.

*Learn about: Local development, testing, and standardized code practices*

---

### [Stage 2: Recipe Library ‚Üí](./aws-bakery-analogy/stage-2)
**Recipe Kits and Version Control**

You create complete recipe kits and store them at the local library for others to access. The librarians help track all your recipe changes and versions.

*Learn about: GitHub, version control, and code repositories*

---

### [Stage 3: Home Distribution ‚Üí](./aws-bakery-analogy/stage-3)
**Home Kitchen Struggles**

As demand grows, you try to serve customers from your home kitchen but face serious scaling problems with equipment, capacity, and reliability.

*Learn about: Home server limitations and scaling challenges*

---

### [Stage 4: Commercial Partnership ‚Üí](./aws-bakery-analogy/stage-4)
**AWS Cloud Services**

You partner with a commercial bakery chain that provides industrial kitchens, storage, delivery networks, and customer management - letting you focus on creating amazing recipes.

*Learn about: AWS services, cloud infrastructure, and scalable solutions*

## Why This Journey Matters

Just like your bakery business, every web application faces the same fundamental challenges:
- How to develop and test ideas effectively
- How to manage and track changes safely  
- How to handle growing demand reliably
- How to scale globally while maintaining quality

By the end of your journey, you'll understand not just *what* AWS services do, but *why* they exist and *when* to use them in your own projects.
