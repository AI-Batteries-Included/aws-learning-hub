More people are getting interested in your cobbler, but many don't know the first thing about baking. Walking each person through getting the recipe from the library, setting up their kitchen properly, and baking the cobbler is complicated and time-consuming.

You decide to start using your home kitchen to assemble recipe kits and distribute finished cobblers straight from your house. Now people can experience your baking exactly as you intended - as a finished product, without needing to assemble it themselves.

## The Scaling Problems Begin

As your cobbler becomes more popular, serious problems emerge:

### Kitchen Capacity Issues

– You can only output so much from your home oven– You still need to use it for your own meals– Peak demand times overwhelm your single oven
### Equipment Strain and Maintenance

– Constant use breaks your appliances more frequently– You need to pay for professional repair help– Every breakdown means no cobblers can be delivered– You're spending more time fixing equipment than baking
### Personal Burnout

– You are a baker, not a logistics expert– The distribution stress takes away from your passion: creating new recipes– You can't focus on innovation while managing delivery problems
## The Technical Reality

Home servers face identical challenges:

```bash
# Home server limitations
Max concurrent users: ~10-50
Bandwidth: Limited by home internet plan  
Uptime dependency: Your personal schedule
Backup power: None (power outages = downtime)
```

**Common Home Server Problems:**

– Limited bandwidth during peak traffic– No redundancy if hardware fails– Internet service outages affect availability– Power outages cause complete downtime– Security vulnerabilities without professional management

## The Breaking Point

Your customer base continues growing, but your home kitchen setup is becoming unsustainable:

**Daily Reality:**
– 6 AM: Start first batch of cobblers
– 8 AM: Oven breaks down, spend 2 hours troubleshooting
– 10 AM: Finally back to baking, but behind schedule
– 2 PM: Internet outage, can't process orders
– 4 PM: Overwhelmed with delivery logistics
– 8 PM: Too exhausted to experiment with new recipes

**The Cost of DIY Scaling:**

– Hardware upgrades every few months– Expensive repair technician visits– Lost customers due to downtime– Missed opportunities for innovation– Personal stress and burnout
## What You Need

To scale successfully, you realize you need:

– Professional-grade kitchen equipment that doesn't break– Multiple ovens that can handle peak demand– Reliable power and connectivity– Professional maintenance and support– Ability to focus on recipes, not infrastructure
## The Realization

You understand that while home-based operations work for small-scale testing and development, they simply cannot handle the demands of a growing business. You need professional infrastructure that scales automatically and reliably.

The question becomes: How can you access enterprise-grade facilities without the massive upfront investment of building your own commercial kitchen?

## The Solution Awaits

Your home kitchen served you well for development and small-scale operations, but growth demands professional infrastructure. What if there was a way to access commercial-grade facilities without building them yourself?
